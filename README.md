FFXIV_DataExtractor
===================

This is a fork of [FFXIV Explorer by Ioncannon](https://bitbucket.org/Ioncannon/ffxiv-explorer/overview) with some usability changes and new features.

## TODO
[ ] Learn Java
[ ] Export just the oggToSCD converter, because I don't care about the other stuff.
[ ] Figure out why the converter does not loop properly with the right sample numbers from Audacity.
