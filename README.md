FFXIV_DataExtractor
===================

This is a fork of [FFXIV Explorer by Ioncannon](https://bitbucket.org/Ioncannon/ffxiv-explorer/overview) with some usability changes and new features.

The main purpose is to do the following below, because I'm not going through manual testing again.


Subtracting 109000 samples from the actual sample count I had from Audacity for "Torn from the Heavens - Distant Worlds" seemed to work. I don't know if that will work with other files because of file size and all that...

## TODO
- [ ] Learn Java
- [ ] Export just the oggToSCD converter, because I don't care about the other stuff.
- [ ] Figure out why the converter does not loop properly with the right sample numbers from Audacity.
